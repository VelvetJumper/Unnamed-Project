# Unnamed-Project
This project is a 2D video game with a pixel design-style. It will center around a young witch or wizard and their journey through school learning spells, gaining familiars, and choosing their path through magic. Their experience is upturned, however, when the protagonist discovers more sinister happenings in their small town. What will you do when faced with tough decisions and who will you protect?

This game is a work-in-progress and is set to be completed in June 2024. It will feature branching dialogue options, a skill tree, character customization, relationship development, team play (with NPCs), and more! Stay tuned for updates here.
